While at [Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/) I read [Computing and Management BSc](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/a-z/computing-and-management-bsc/). The goal of this course was to give students a well-balanced education of hybrid skills; covering Computer Science courses with additional modules from the Business school for management, psychology and marketing. I took the four-year variant with an Industrial Placement. I was employed as a Web Developer by [Andalucia.com](https://www.andalucia.com/) and relocated to the south of Spain.
