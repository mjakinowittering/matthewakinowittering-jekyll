I have found listening to Roman Pichler's book "[How to Lead in Product Management](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/How-to-Lead-in-Product-Management-Audiobook/B08FCWFLZM){:targat="_blank"}" a great help. From my perspective, I believe the vast majority of books and training materials that I'd found to date for product management had too narrow a focus on the product vision, discovery, requirements, planning and execution.

Roman's recent book isn't unique. There are increasingly more texts on product leadership and professional growth. With that said, I found listening to his book on Audible pleasing as it covers what I feel is nearly universally assumed. We're already fantastic communicators equipped with the necessary armour to receive difficult feedback during challenging conversations with customers and stakeholders.

Roman provides plenty of helpful techniques with examples to highlight why listening deeply with empathy is crucial to collaborate effectively and develop the necessary trust for product leadership. If you're not immediately convinced, I suggest you try a few episodes of [Roman's Product Podcast](https://www.romanpichler.com/podcast/){:taget="_blank"}.
