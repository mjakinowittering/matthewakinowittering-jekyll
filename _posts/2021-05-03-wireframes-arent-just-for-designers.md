I was only just getting started in product management, working as a junior at Ask Jeeves, when I first came across wireframes. With a bit of artistic flair, I found one can easily layout screen controls in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/){:target="_blank"} to draw enough to show what a webpage could or should do. Just like this 'Mind the Product' article says, "[Wireframes Aren’t Just for Designers](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/wireframes-arent-just-for-designers/){:target="_blank"}". They're a thinking and communication tool for Product Managers.

I am positive they're a great way to help form your ideas when you're while ideating. If you're prepared to use Balsamiq or pen and paper, they'll provide you with the agility to further assess a hypothesis, fail quickly and learn more. It's easy to become preoccupied with find this solution. However, it's always important to remember there is a team around you to help you do the following:

> The role of a product manager is to discover a product that is valuable, usable, and feasible.

Your wireframes will be a helpful communication tool to share the ideas you've distilled with your teammates during a discovery meeting. Similar to a storyboard used in film and television to convey the protagonist's journey. Ideally, the team's designer will revise your concept and produce a Hi-Fi clickable prototype. Next, you should validate these ideas with your stakeholders. Or, better still, perform some initial user testing. Ultimately your initial wireframes, you should be able to learn:

1. Has the team discovered a solution to the customer's problem?
2. Can this be built?

I hope you give it a try.
