While at Loughborough University I took part in the [Industrial Placement](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/a-z/computing-and-management-bsc/#placement-year) programme. I did this at Andalucia Web Solutions (AWS), operating on the Costa del Sol. My responsibilities at AWS included constructing and modifying client websites and updating content [Andalucia.com](http://andalucia.com/) and trafficking advertisements to the same site. Andalucia.com is an information portal operated by AWS publishes information for tourists and expatriates in the south of Spain.
