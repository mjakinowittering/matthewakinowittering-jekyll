Acorn-i is an agency that specialises in supporting brands and merchants selling their products on Amazon. Our managed service covers the listing of products, activating advertising campaigns and managing stock levels. As their Lead Product Manager, I have worked closely with the Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founders to deliver our shared vision for our product, Ignite by Acorn-i. Ignite not only underpins our Managed Service business but is used by SaaS customers who wish to retain the software after In-Housing or have licensed it directly. 

Ignite is an omnichannel analytics platform that consolidates eCommerce data from Amazon, Shopify and WooCommerce along with advertising data from Amazon, Facebook and Google. The goal of the product is to provide operational improvements for our customers by consolidating performance data into a suite of unified dashboards with actionable insights to drive further success. To do so we utilise AWS Lambda, S3, Athena, SQS and SageMaker, the Snowflake cloud data warehouse and Angular web framework. 

Over the last two years Iâ€™ve mapped out our Product Vision, identify key product Personas for our customer groups, contributed to the tiering of functionality for our pricing strategy and defined our product management processes. I meet regularly with our Co-Founders and CTO to discuss our Theme-base-Roadmap to ensure alignment around desired outcomes and report progress during our fortnightly Product Council meetings. To realise our vision, I work closely with our technology partner Tech Magic to implement our product narratives and user stories. I work closely with our product team comprised of Engineers, QA Engineers and UI/UX Designers to deliver our vision.
