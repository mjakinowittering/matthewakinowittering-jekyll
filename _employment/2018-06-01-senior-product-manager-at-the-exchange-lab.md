Within the Product and Engineering department, I was the Lead Product Manager for the Vendor Integrations team. Together we developed software to retrieve and process data from our AdTech partners. The team and I were responsible for a portfolio of three products: 

1. Vendor Integration Engine, a highly scaled data collection engine. 
2. Data Lake, for conforming event-level advertising data required by our data warehouse. 
3. Entity Store, for normalising campaign setup metadata used by dashboards. 

The system typically processed seven to ten terabytes of new data daily. To do so we utilised AWS EC2, S3, EMR and Elasticsearch. There was a small React web app to administer the application and Grafana dashboards for monitoring. 

I produced stories and technical documentation to enact our roadmap. This information was derived from external API documentation or by collaborating with partners to access custom data feeds. I presented these new requirements to the team during Feature Kick-off meetings and solicit feedback to realise the full solution based on their expertise. When requirements were certain, the new item would be added to our Kanban board.
