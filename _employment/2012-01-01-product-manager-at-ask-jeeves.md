After being promoted, my responsibilities in the SEO Group and focused on product growth for seniors stakeholders at Ask.com and About.com. Due to algorithm changes by Google Panda to penalise large content sites â€“ it was necessary to be more scientific to identify potential problem areas ahead of time and protect advertisement yields. 

To that end, much of my time was spent on investigative work to identified poorer content. This was largely achieved by using Data Science tools for Natural Language Processing and reviewing website traffic. The goal was to detect and modify over-optimised content pages or unsatisfactory content. The results of this ongoing analysis highlighted poorly structured pages requiring revision by Content Managers and poorer user experiences. We tackled these pragmatically and reinvented the product over several design sprints.
